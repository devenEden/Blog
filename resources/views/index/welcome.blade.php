                        Its not as easy as it sounds, but when you get into the habit of taking in confidence even when you don't feel like it, you will much happier and more at peace than you have ever been.

                        Don't let anyone (including yourself) put you down for any reason and don't put others down either. Encourage others as you encourage yourself. Compliment others as you compliment yourself. Trust me, you get a feeling of satisfaction and joy when you do so and live in a world where everyone is comfortable being themselves.

                    <h4>It's Okay to cut off the toxic people from your life !</h4>
                    <p>
                        Toxic people can do a number on your head — and your heart. Unfortunately, some people truly need to be let go in order for you to stay sane and healthy. You do not have to stay in a relationship with a person who is manipulative, selfish, and either subtly or overtly abusive. It’s incredibly sad to realize that a loved one is a poisonous presence, but it’s also necessary.
                        Not everyone can be saved with love and kindness, and it’s not your job to change someone. Even if it’s a close family member, it’s okay to end a toxic relationship without guilt. It’s not easy, but it might be the healthiest decision you ever make.

                    <h4>Be your own kind of beautiful!</h4>
           <p>We all have what makes us different. It could be your dark or light skin complection, your stretch marks, beautiful big eyes or cute small ones, your full lips or your slim body, your type 4c hair, you name it!
            When you learn to be yourself and love yourself the way you are, then you can appreciate those around you as well without comparing yourself to them.
            "Comparison is the thief of contentment."
            Always remember that!
            Don't try to be like someone else because if you do, you will always be in their shadow. You stand out better being yourself because there is always going to be one "YOU".
            Regardless of race, tribe, skin colour, gender, religion, culture, principles, background, origin, size, body shape etc, we are all special.
            So be your own kind of beautiful</p>

                <h4>Own who you are</h4>
                <p>
                    A lot of us have had times when people around you or friends were sharing maybe things that they like doing and things they find "lame" or "boring" but the things they don't think are "okay" or "cool" are things that you enjoy doing or people that you admire and when they ask you what you think, you just agree with them because you don't want them to think you are weird or anything.
                    If you are that kind of person, then you don't believe that you are perfect and you are insecure about your personality. What makes beautiful relationships and friendships is our differences. Love that you are different and express yourself that way. Don't try to blend in with the world. It is constantly changing and it gets tiring to follow its every opinion. You don't have to be like everyone to be perfect. You are perfection.

               <h4> Be yourself </h4>
               <p>
                Fun or not so fun fact.....there will never be a day not even an hour or minute where everybody in the world likes you or thinks you're perfect.
                That they all appreciate you and who you are....never. There will always be someone that thinks your are too small or too big or too fat or too short or too tall or too light or too dark or too......(fill in) but you get what i mean.
                So i will say, the one thing I have learnt is that you should learn to always be perfect to yourself. Love yourself and come to terms with the fact that not everyone will like you but what matters is that you love you. So that in the end, even if someone shows you or tells you they don't like you, it doesn't affect you as much.
                Also, always remember to surround yourself with positive energy. In other words, people that encourage you and make you feel loved. Stay away from anything negative, no matter how "good" or "cool" they seem to be, if they make you feel like you're less than you are then they are not worth it. Believe me.

               <h4> Express who are</h4>
               <p>
                There are a lot of people who think men's mental health isn't a big deal because they won't express their pain or depression or hurt in public.
                In a lot of societies men are told to "man up" and "move on" but that is not right.
                Boys or men that express their emotions or feelings outwardly are called things like "sissy" or "gay" or other really insensitive things. I can't even tell you how many times I've had to tell off people or stop people talking to me from talking about my guy friends or guys in general like that.
                It's absolutely ridiculous that people think men can't be traumatised or harassed or hurt. THEY CAN!
                Please be careful what you say to or about the people around you. Even if its a female talking to or about a male or a male talking to or about a fellow male, your words matter so don't be insensitive.
                To the ladies, emancipation doesn't mean that we should be insensitive towards men or be disrespectful. Continue to support your fellow women but emancipation is fighting for equality, so support the men as well. Especially when someone around you is being insensitive.
                Mental health is important to all genders. Please don't forget that. Don't be ignorant and don't let those around you be ignorant either.
                Spread the message. Let's fight against these stereotypes together
